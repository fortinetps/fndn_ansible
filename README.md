# Fortinet Ansible Modules
The Fortinet Developer Network is pleased to offer Ansible solutions for Fortinet products. 
This repository will contain the latest versions of Ansible components:
* Modules
* Module_Utils
* Plugins
* Playbooks
* Unit Tests

Fortinet maintains this repository, 
so you can be sure you have the latest versions of code written 
by folks who know Fortinet products best.

However, this doesn't mean we don't appreciate contributions!
If you have any to offer, please use the pull request features in Github to 
submit any changes for review. Contributions are not limited to module changes, 
if you have created an awesome playbook, we want to see it!

At the moment, we only have FortiManager modules released, but expect more soon.
